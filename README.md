# splitwise-group-expenses

My partners and I use [splitwise](https://www.splitwise.com/) to manage our household expenses, but a few things like groceries we split un-evenly. I was tired of always having to re-type the perentages into the Splitwise form, which is a bit clunky and unwieldy. So I made a little app to make it easier!
